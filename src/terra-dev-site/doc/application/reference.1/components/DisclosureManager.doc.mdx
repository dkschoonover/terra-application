# DisclosureManager

Manages application disclosures. See terra-disclosure-manager for general usage details.

## Dismiss Callback Stack
Content disclosed with terra-application's DisclosureManager can be dismissed from outside of a
DisclosureManager's component hierarchy by calling `closeMostRecentDisclosure`.  This
function will close the most recent disclosure that occurred through any terra-application DisclosureManager instance.
The function will return a promise that will be resolved after the disclosure is successfully closed.  If no content
is currently disclosed, a resolved promise will be returned.

If needed, the number of active disclosures can be checked using `getActiveDisclosureCount`.
